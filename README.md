data for Wood &amp; Young: Social dominance and rainfall predict telomere dynamics in a cooperative arid-zone bird

The following files will be uploaded on acceptance of the paper under licence CC0, but will be made available to reviewers on request from emmamwood85@gmail.com

## Files:
Wood_Young_Adult_telomeres_age_partition.csv: *data for investigating long-term telomere dynamics in known-age white-browed sparrow-weavers*  
Wood_Young_Adult_telomeres_seasonal_dynamics: *data for investigating short-term telomere dynamics in known-age white-browed sparrow-weavers*  

## Column names and descriptions for all files:
BIRD: unique code for each individual bird  

Dominance: DOM for dominant, SUB for subordinate  

Sex: F for female, M for male  

Bird.age: age of bird at time of sampling (in days)  

Mean.Age: mean bird.age for each bird  

Delta.Age: difference between the age at which the sample was taken and the mean age for that bird  

Start.ageCl: Age-class of the bird when first seen and ringed. N for nestling, F for fledgling, A for adult  

Start.Error: Uncertainty of hatch date in days

Season: Breedomg season in which the sample pair was taken. Each breeding season starts between September and November (depending on conditions), and ends between March and May the following calendar year.  

Season.plus: takes the form of season_1 or season_2. The number represents whether the sample was taken at the beginning (1) or end (2) of the breeding (1) season. This variable is used in the age-partition model as a random effect.  

Period: BREEDING for Breeding season, WINTER for non-breeding season 

DNA.Date1: for seasonal data, date on which the first sample of the pair was taken  

DNA.Date2: for seasonal data, date on which the first sample of the pair was taken  

Group: Unique codes for each social group 

Group1: for seasonal data, social group the bird belonged to when the first sample of the sample-pair was taken  

Group2: for seasonal data, social group the bird belonged to when the second sample of the sample-pair was taken  

Ad.GS: for seasonal data, mean number of adults in the social group/s to which the bird belonged over the period flanked by the two samples. 

Plate: ID of the qPCR plate on which the sample/ sample pair was run  

Position: triplicate position on the qPCR plate   

Total.rain: Rainfall (in mm) over the 365 days preceding the date when the second sample was taken

RTL: relative telomere length measured by qPCR 

DMonths: for seasonal data, Verhulst's D / number of months (including decimals as this was calculated using number of days). Verhulst's D calculated using RTL1 (first RTL measure of the pair) and RTL2 (second RTL measure of the pair)
